These slides illustrate the usage of `C` and `C++` from `R` using the
`.Call` interface and the `Rcpp` package. These slides were originally
part of a general advanced R programming and development course and
have now been expanded and made into an individual module.  The
working examples are inherited from the original course working
example, DNA/RNA class system that allows to read sequence data in
fasta format, transcribe DNA into RNA, reverse, complement sequences,
etc and illustrate DNA sequence GC counting.

These slides have been used for the RSS 
[Practical statistical computing: A workshop on advanced R](http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fas/maths/events/001138/rss-local-group-practical-statistical-computing-a-workshop-on-advanced-r), organised by the Lancaster RSS group (see `2013-05-21_AdvancedRWorkshop_Lancaster` tag).

The `rc.[R]md` document was developed for an [R
bootcamp](https://github.com/lgatto/rbc/tree/2014-11-06-Zurich).

See also the educational [`sequences`](https://github.com/lgatto/sequences/) package for inclusion
of the example into a package.
