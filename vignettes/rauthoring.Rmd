Authoring document for R
========================

# R Markdown

## Introduction

This document introduces some tools to author documents that contain
analysis results produced with R. Bringing data, results and their
interpretation is essential for assuring reproducibility of an
analysis pipeline and the results and comprehensively communicating
these results to your collaborators. A popular solution for this is
*literate programming*, a technique and set of tools that permit to

1. Write text and code within a single document. Here we will use the
   simple markdown syntax and include R code chunks; such documents
   are denoted *R markdown* and have the `Rmd` extension.
2. Extract (called *tangling*) and execute the code
3. Replace the original code chunks by their results into the original
   document (called *weaving*).
4. Compile the document into a final easily read format such as pdf or
   html.

Steps 2 to 4 are can be executed individually or automated into a
single command such as `knit2html` from the `knitr` package or using
editors such as Rstudio.

## Markdown syntax

The figure below, taken from
[the Rstudio markdown (v2) tutorial](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html)
illustrates basic markdown syntax and its output using Rstudio.

- Headers can be defined using `======` or `-----` (level 1 and 2
  respectively) or one or multiple `#` (for level 1, 2,
  ... respectively).

- Italic and bold fonts are defined using one to two `*` around the
  text.

- Bullet lists items start with a `-`.

- In-line code and verbatim expression are surrounded by  `` ` ``.

- Code blocks start and end with three back ticks.

- Starting a line with `>` offsets the text.

## R code chunks

To include R code in the R markdown file, the native code chunk
syntax is augmented with code chunk tags inside `{r, ...}`, as
illustrated below:

![Markdown code chunk](./Figures/markdownChunk.png)

The following optimal code chunk options are available:

- `{r, chunkname}` the first unnamed string is used to name the code
  chunk; useful for following the code execution and debugging.

- `{r, eval=TRUE}` by default the code in the chunk is
  executed. Alternatively, set `eval=FALSE`.

- `{r, echo=TRUE}` by default, the code is displayed before the
  output. Use `echo=FALSE` to hide the code.

- Control if messages, warnings or errors are to be displayed with
  `{r, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, error=TRUE}`.

- Figure dimensions can be controlled with `fig.height` and
  `fig.width`.

To execute in-line code, use `` ` r 1+1` `` (no space between `` ` ``
and `r`).

## From `Rmd` to `html`

If you are using Rstudio, the simplest way to generate your final
output is to open your `Rmd` file and click the `Knit HTML` (or `Knit
PDF`, ...) button. From R, you can use the `knit2html` function and
give the `Rmd` as input. Both options will use the `knit` function to
*weave* the document and generate the markdown `md` file that includes
the code outputs. The generation of the final output will depend on
the software version you use: either `markdown::markdownToHTML` or the
more recent `rmarkdown::render` functions. 

> Exercise: Experiment with R markdown and the features described so
> far. Either create your `Rmd` file from scratch or use the simple
> template from the `rauthoring` package with `rmdtemplate()`.

## More markdown

- Superscript^2^ using `  ^2^  ` and ~~strikethrough~~ using `  ~~strikethrough~~  `.

- To use ordered lists, just preced to list items by their respective number:
    1. first item
    2. second item
    3. and so on ...


- To use links, enclose the link text in `[]` and the the actual link
  in `()`: ` [my link](http://linkurl.com) `

- To add a static figure to the document, use the link syntax and
  precede it by `!`: ` ![image text](./fig/myfig.png) `.

- Tables can easily be printed inside an R chunk

```{r, table}
head(mtcars)
```

   The most recent version of R Markdown also has a table syntax
   described
   [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html#tables). Such
   tables can be generated with the helper function
   `knitr::kable`. Such tables are then displayed as html
   tables. Instead of copy/pasting the output of `kabble` into the R
   makdown document, one can specify `results='asis'` for the output
   of the code chunk to be interpreted as is, i.e. write raw results
   from R into the output document.

```{r, table2}
library("knitr")
kable(head(mtcars))
```

```{r, table3, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
library("knitr")
kable(head(mtcars))
```

- To avoid wasting time in repeating long calculations over and over
  again, it is possible to cache specific code chunks specifying
  `cache=TRUE` in the chunk header.


- The most recent release of [R mardown (version 2)]() supports many
  more features and requires a recent version of
  [`pandoc`](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), the workhorse that
  converts mardown to html and many other formats.

> Try out some of these additional features in your own `Rmd` file or
> look at this vignettes source code. Find where it is with
> `system.file("doc/rauthoring.Rmd", package = "rauthoring")`.

# ReportingTools

The Bioconductor
[`ReportingTools`](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ReportingTools.html)
provides additional features to generate reports. From the
[Bioc landing page](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ReportingTools.html):

    The ReportingTools software package enables users to easily
	display reports of analysis results generated from sources such as
	microarray and sequencing data. The package allows users to create
	HTML pages that may be viewed on a web browser such as Safari, or
	in other formats readable by programs such as Excel. Users can
	generate tables with sortable and filterable columns, make and
	display plots, and link table entries to other data sources such
	as NCBI or larger plots within the HTML page. Using the package,
	users can also produce a table of contents page to link various
	reports together for a particular project that can be viewed in a
	web browser. For more examples, please visit our site:
	http://research-pub.gene.com/ReportingTools.


For example, to create a html report that contains an interactive html table:

```{r, reptools, eval=FALSE}
library("ReportingTools")
htmlRep <- HTMLReport(shortName = "htmltable",
                      reportDirectory = "./reports")
publish(mtcars, htmlRep)
finish(htmlRep)
browseURL("./reports/htmltable.html")
```
> Generate the above dynamic html table as shown above.

In particular, it seamlessly integrates with `kntir` and R markdown
documents, as illustrated in the
[`knitrreptools` vignette](./knitrreptools.html). 

See the `ReportingTools` vignettes for more details and other use cases:

```{r, reptoolsvigs, eval=FALSE}
vignette(package = "ReportingTools")
```

# Web applications with `shiny`

# Session information

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```
