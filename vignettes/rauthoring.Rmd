Authoring document for `R`
========================

# Introduction

This document introduces some tools to author documents that contain
analysis results produced with `R`. Bringing data, results and their
interpretation is essential for assuring reproducibility of an
analysis pipeline and the results and comprehensively communicating
these results to your collaborators. A popular solution for this is
*literate programming*, a technique and set of tools that permit to

1. Write text and code within a single document. Here we will use the
   simple markdown syntax and include `R` code chunks; such documents
   are denoted *R markdown* and have the `Rmd` extension.
2. Extract (called *tangling*) and execute the code
3. Replace the original code chunks by their results into the original
   document (called *weaving*).
4. Compile the document into a final easily read format such as pdf or
   html.

Steps 2 to 4 are can be executed individually or automated into a
single command such as `knit2html` from the `knitr` package or using
editors such as Rstudio.

# Markdown syntax

The figure below, taken from
[the Rstudio markdown (v2) tutorial](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html)
illstrates basic markdown syntax and its output using Rstudio.

- Headers can be defined using `======` or `-----` (level 1 and 2
  respectively) or one or multiple `#` (for level 1 or lower).

- Italic and bold fonts are defined using one to two `*` around the
  text.

- Bullet lists items start with a `-`.

- In-line code and verbatim expression are surrounded by back ticks.

- Code blocks start and end with three back ticks.

- Starting a line with `>` offsets the text.

x <- c("Hello", "world")
x <- paste(x, collapse = " ")
cat(x)
```
